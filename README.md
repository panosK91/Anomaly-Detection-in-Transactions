# Transaction Anomaly Detection System

## Project Overview
This repository contains the Transaction Anomaly Detection System, a sophisticated tool designed to identify unusual transaction patterns within financial datasets using machine learning techniques. The system leverages Python and various libraries to preprocess data, perform exploratory data analysis, and deploy an anomaly detection model that flags transactions deviating from established norms.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Utilizes Pandas for cleaning and preparing data, handling missing values, and deriving statistical insights.
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Employs Plotly Express to create dynamic visualizations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to explore data distributions and correlations.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Implements an Isolation Forest algorithm, configured to detect and flag transactions that are significantly different from the norm.
- **Model Evaluation**: Uses classification metrics to assess the performance and accuracy of the anomaly detection model.
- **User Interaction**: Includes a functionality for users to input new transaction data and receive real-time analysis, enhancing the system's applicability in live scenarios.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Plotly Express
- scikit-learn
